# Scikit-learn Workshop

Welcome to the Simple Scikit-Learn Workshop! This workshop is designed to introduce you to the basics of machine learning using the scikit-learn library in Python. By the end of this workshop, you'll have a solid understanding of how to build and evaluate machine learning models using scikit-learn.

## Introduction

Scikit-learn is a powerful Python library for machine learning that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It is built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib and is open source, commercially usable, and BSD-licensed.

## Installation

To participate in this workshop, you will need to have Python and scikit-learn installed on your machine. You can install scikit-learn using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

You will also need NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Workshop Outline

The workshop will cover the following topics:

1. Introduction to Scikit-Learn
2. Loading and Understanding Data
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Building Machine Learning Models
5. Evaluating Model Performance
6. Hyperparameter Tuning
7. Model Selection
8. Practical Exercises

## Dataset

For this workshop, we will use the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to classify the samples into three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the workshop repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scikit-learn-workshop.git
cd scikit-learn-workshop
```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook provided for the workshop:

```bash
jupyter notebook workshop.ipynb
```

## Code Examples

Below are some code snippets that you will encounter during the workshop:

### Loading the Dataset

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
import pandas as pd

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
df = pd.DataFrame(data=iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)
df['target'] = iris.target
print(df.head())
```

### Splitting the Data

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X = df.drop('target', axis=1)
y = df['target']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Training a Model

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Train a Random Forest classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Evaluating the Model

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Predict and evaluate the model
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

## Exercises

1. **Exercise 1:** Load a different dataset from scikit-learn and explore its structure.
2. **Exercise 2:** Preprocess the data by handling missing values and scaling features.
3. **Exercise 3:** Build a different machine learning model (e.g., Support Vector Machine) and evaluate its performance.
4. **Exercise 4:** Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
5. **Exercise 5:** Compare the performance of multiple models and choose the best one.
